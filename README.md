# QuoteGenerator
 
This is my Capstone Project for Udacity "Android Kotlin Developer" Course.

OVERVIEW

As the name suggests, Quote Generator gives the user the chanche to get a random quote by some famous people from the world and save it to a personal "favorite quotes" list. 

The app consists of three screen: a Home Fragment, a Quote Fragment and a FavoriteQuotesList Fragment. 
In order to achieve the desired functionality the quotes are retrieved from three separate public API that serve as providers. After generating a random quote from one of the providers, the user has the chance to save the generated quote in a "Favorite Quotes" list or generate a new random quote.

- Home Fragment
![HomeFragment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98179119/158987538-bf877903-b1dd-4c3e-b8d0-fe2861393bb9.png)

In the HomeFragment the user is prompted to choose a provider for the quote. The providers are represented by three separate public API that serve the purpose. Inside this fragment is also present a "Picture of the day" as a little treat. The image is retrieved from a fourth public API.
