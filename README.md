# QuoteGenerator
 
This is the first app I'm making "on my own", it's more like an exercise.

Basically it consists of a single activity with textViews showing a random quote + auhtor and a button to refresh the quote.
At the bottom of the main view a INFO button triggers a dialog with the About section.

At the moment the quotes are retrieved from https://zenquotes.io/ API
